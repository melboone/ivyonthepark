		<p>A considered blend of contemporary flair and relaxed comfort, Ivy On the Park has the best of both worlds.</p>
		<article>Sparkling engineered floorboards create a welcome sense of space in the living areas, which open out onto park-inspired courtyards and balconies. The smart touches flow into the kitchen, where white and grey cabinets are front and centre and woodgrain timber sits overhead to create a classically understated look, while 20mm white stone benchtops, a mirrored splashback and Bosch appliances are a tempting trio. The bathrooms capture the same quality feel with porcelain tiles, and carpet has been carefully chosen for the bedrooms.
